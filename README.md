## Project [![up]](https://github.com/amhalrasheed/Workshop-2#table-of-contents)


The project that was implemented in this github repository, 
Is a machine learning algorithm that runs on the web. 
The project will have two sides once it is up and running, a client side and a server side. The server side will be in charge of validating the client-side inputs and running the algorithm to determine the appropriate label for the user's input, 
Food items, such as tomato, cheese, and meat, will be sent by the user, and the server will respond with "Burger."
